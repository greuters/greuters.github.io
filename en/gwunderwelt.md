How well does a solar bike work?  
Good enough to make us carry our panels on a second big tour for sure!

In this post of our first journey [you can find detailed statistics]({{ site.url }}/nordkapp-solar/2018/09/30/ausgebloggt.html).  
We're using flexible panels from [Somalux](https://www.somalux.ch/), as used in camping and marine applications.
