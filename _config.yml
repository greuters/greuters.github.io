# "assets/images" is explicitly not excluded from localization. This is necessary to be able to statically verify that
# all images used in any blog post, no matter its language, are available. The check is done in load-images.liquid.
#
# For further info check polyglot bug https://github.com/untra/polyglot/issues/131
# -> static files are not available for sub-language pages when they are excluded from localization
#
# After each build, the 'replace-images' script from package.json deletes all redundant localized image copies and
# ensures the resized versions generated by jekyll-responsive-image are available in the appropriate location.
#
# For the same reason, assets/tracks is not excluded from localization at the moment, instead the files are removed
# and replaced with links to the original asset after build in package.json
