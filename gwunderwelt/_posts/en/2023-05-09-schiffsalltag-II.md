  Exchanging conversations and thoughts, laughing at simple jokes, watching dolphins and eagerly awaiting a possible second appearance of the whale that someone has just seen. Listening to music and playing the guitar. Writing The Epic in a bottle and searching for Ringelnatz's secret on the mast. Playing ten-thousand, backgammon and tichu, reading, blogging and diary writing, making world maps and browsing the atlas. Watching films, sweat during yoga or fitness sports, splicing ribbons and fancywork (elaborate knots). Showering, showering again and again (:
  Seeking shade, just being. Painting, drawing, designing motors and turning gears in our heads..

  We certainly didn't get bored, even if the horizon seemed too close at times. A proven remedy for this - these recommendations from our well-stocked on-board library:

## Welt mit Zukunft: Die Ã¶kosoziale Perspektive
_Franz Josef Radermacher_

 How is a world conceivable in which we enable a good life for all, a globally just future, within the limits of our planet? This follow-up to "The Limits to Growth" shows possibilities, proposes one vision of such a world and highlights the big global governance issues that need to be addressed to get there. Unfortunately, some of the necessary proposed approaches have not been implemented in the 10 years since the book was published, but nevertheless successful examples like the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer show how we can tackle climate change and give hope for a future for us on this planet.

## Unter den Sternen
_Francesco Zingoni_

 A mystical love story, a gripping novel after a slow, poetical start. Mauke Nuha. What is a life about, shaped by the sea after a stroke of fate? What is it all about, our humanity? 

----
## Dschungelkind
_Sabine Kuegler_

As already mentioned in a previous blog, a touching autobiography of an extraordinary life story. Sabine Kuegler grew up in the jungles of Papua as a neighbour of the Fayu, a people caught up in a deadly spiral of honour killings. An outside perspective and their own will to make a difference seem to have made a change for the better possible for all the people involved.

##  Hand, Reef and Steer
_Tom Cunliffe_

A fun to read bible on gaff-rigged boat building and sailing from an author with impressive knowledge and experience on the art of creating (not engineering!) sailing boats. 

----
## The Complete Riggers Apprentice
_Brian Toss_

Why are ropes one of mankind's most versatile tools, whose importance has endured for millennia? How is it possible to harness the immense forces of wind and water for one's own locomotion with small nutshells and the simplest of means? The definitive standard work for anyone who wants to learn the fine art of rigging. Somewhat technical and full of deep insight into the details that make both traditional and modern sailing possible and safe.
