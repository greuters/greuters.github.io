Quebec. In the provincial capital of the same name, we enjoy a few quiet days with Boromir, Maude and Manillo. We explore the pretty town, polish our bike and enjoy delicacies from the oven: Lasagne, Gateau Chomeur, pizza, spaetzle and dragon bowl... we eat well and drink one or two delicious or local wines with our hosts. Rita's photos are not neglected either: the two of them actually like to travel themselves, but are currently a little more location-bound with a small child - so we like to wander off into the distance on picture evenings, and back to our memories.

In the port city, we once again try to find a crossing on a cargo ship, this time in person. After a hopeful start, we are turned down once more - we have one last chance in Halifax, but it doesn't look too good. Well, for now we continue down the St. Lawrence River. A stately river in Quebec, it soon becomes more of a shallow fjord and actual sea. After three days, the opposite shore, almost 50 km away, is barely visible. We set sail south from the Gulf and are curious to see if the sound of the sea is already waiting on the other side of the headland... but first we follow a picturesque little river through autumnal forests to New Brunswick.

And guess what! Even beyond the hills, the bays are sheltered, the water is still, with amazing tidal phenomena to observe but no surf. Only in Halifax, on a day trip to the beach, do we hear the longed-for waves, the final sign that we have made it from one ocean to another.

We are spoiled with muffins every day at Arlene, Bradley and Karen's, find a loving home for a few days and the obligatory trip to Peggys Cove is also included. The language, which is not always easy for us to follow, a great evening in the Irish pub - with live music and black beer like in the stories - and the kilt-wearing guards on the Halifax fort leave no doubt: we have landed in Nova Scotia. An anything but authentic harbor tour on the tourist sailing ship makes us feel the wind wistfully despite everything. How much would we love to sail across the Atlantic again... but unfortunately there is nothing to be done about ship passage here either, we will finally fly to Iceland.
